		============================ -->
        <section id="idocs_explanation">
          <h2>Why I made this blog/post</h2>
          <p class="lead">Because politics really suck when other people don't really even argue with your actual positions.</p>
          <p>Whenever actual political positions are argued, there is always a high risk of getting your own positions completely misunderstood, something that has happened to me over the past few months whenever I've tried to debate policies and political positions.</p>
          <p>In this blog I want to clear out any kind of misunderstanding that people might have about my actual political positions, because the last thing I want is to have people arguing about a strawman of me, and not my actual ideas.</p>
          <p>I also want to make this blog with the objective of keeping up with my own political positions, in order to try to be as consistent and charitable as possible when it comes to debates.</p>

        <!-- Political Landscape
		============================ -->
        <section id="idocs_political_landscape">
          <h2>Current online landscape when it comes to political debates</h2>
          <p>The sad truth is that there have been many instances in which the online political landscape is disappointing, but there have also been many instances in which fruitful conversations can arise.</p>
          <p>I think everyone's main goal when it comes to political ideas should be to try to push for reasonable policies grounded in facts that can allow us to improve as a society</p>
          <p>I believe that most people don't really think that much when it comes to the policies that they are trying to push for, aswell as a lack of philosophical grounding that would allow them to defend those positions according to moral axioms.</p>
          <p>I think it is of high importance to try to understand the basics of a few other areas before actually engaging with political ideas. A few resources I would highly encourage to check out are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNYJQaZUDrI&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNgK6MZucdYldNkMybYIHKR">Crash Course - Philosophy</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ez10ADR_gM&list=PL1oDmcs0xTD-dJN1PL2N1urX0EKupBJCQ">Crash Course - Economics</a></li>

            <li><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/">Stanford Encyclopedia Of Philosophy</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>When it comes to reading theory about communism/anarchism, I think it is very important for people to read theory,but at the same time not reading theory shouldn't necessarily be a gate-keeping instrument, as nowadays information can be found in many different flavours than only reading theory.</p>

		<!-- Philosophy
		============================ -->
        <section id="idocs_philosophy">
          <h2>Philosophy</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-5">The philosophy behind the policies for which I push for.</p>
        </section>


        <!-- Moral Axioms
		============================ -->
        <section id="idocs_moral_axioms">
          <h2>Moral Axioms</h2>
          <p>I believe that it is important for everyone to first understand their respective moral axioms through philosophical means, because doing so will enable you to engage with politics in a much profound way.</p>
          <p>I don't have a college-level education when it comes to philosophy, however, thanks to the use of different resources and informing myself about different moral frameworks I've been able to produce what I think is a consistent moral framework</p>
          <p>My two main moral axioms are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Freedom</li>
            <li>Equality</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Philosophical Foundations</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Part 1
              <ol>
                <li>I exist.</li>
                <li>I have an experience.</li>
                <li>I want to maximize my experience.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              Part 2
              <ol>
                <li>Others exist.</li>
                <li>Others have an experience.</li>
                <li>Others want to maximize their experience.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              Part 3
              <ol>
                <li>Humans helping and co-existing with one another create better experiences.</li>
                <li>If I help and co-exist with others, it will maximize my experience.</li>
                <li>Others will help and co-exist with me to maximize their experience.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>

		<!-- Categorical Imperatives
		============================ -->
        <section id="idocs_categorical_imperatives">
          <h2>Kant's categorical imperatives</h2>
		      <p class="lead"><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/#TelDeo">More info about it</a></p>
          <p>I firmly believe that a deontological moral framework is not possible, as I <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/">don't believe that moral facts exist</a> , or if they do, we are not prepared enough to fully grasp them. Therefore, I base my own political opinions from these philosophical foundations, taking into account the idea of maximizing the happiness of as many people as possible.</p>

		<!-- Epistemic Responsibility
		============================ -->
        <section id="idocs_epistemic_responsibility">
          <h2>Epistemic Responsibility</h2>
          <p class="lead"> <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-responsibility-epistemic/">More info about epistemology and epistemic responsibility</a></p>
          <p>I firmly believe in the idea of epistemic responsibility, aswell as taking people accountable for their own actions when it comes to spreading misinformation or provoking an overall decrease in the happiness of other sentient beings.</p>
          <p>I do think we have to hold people accountable for what they are doing <strong>nowadays</strong>,rather than the person they were 10 years ago, aswell as taking into account the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/">consequences</a> of their actions.</p>
          <p>Holding them accountable is okay, and it is important to check if they still think about those opinions nowadays, but if they acknowledge the situation and you are still trying to harass them then that is just cringe.</p>

          <p>I firmly believe in utilitarianism, as it could clearly be seen when it comes to my philosophical foundations</p>

		<!-- Determinism, pleasure and post-modernism
		============================ -->
        <section id="idocs_determinism_pleasure_postmodernism">

          <p class="lead"> <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/">More info about determinism</a></p>
          <p class="lead"> <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/postmodernism/">More info about postmodernism</a></p>
          <p>I believe in the philosophical idea that we don't have free-will: just as we can't control physical processes, like gravitational processes, we have to take into account that we, humans, are made out of biological processes that are in fact physical processes themselves.</p>
          <p>I believe that all humans are moved by pleasure, and that there might be an objective moral framework, but just as I said previously, we might never fully grasp it.</p>

		<!-- Contractarianism
		============================ -->

          <p class="lead mb-5"><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractarianism/">More info about the idea of contractarianism</a></p>
          <p>I believe that contractarianism can be an interesting moral framework to take a look in certain cases, and that sometimes it is justified to argue from that moral point of view. However, I do disagree in the case that this moral framework is used as a tool to justify authoritarian threats against minorities.</p>

         <p class="lead mb-5"><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-animal/">More info about the moral status of non-human animals</a></p>
         <p>Moving aside the arguments in favour of the environment;when it comes to the treatment of non-human animals, I firmly believe that we can't really justify eating and provoking unhappiness over non-human animals just for the pleasure of our taste buds.</p>
         <p>For more information about my current positions about this topic, I believe these ones are the most important resources about the matter: </p>
         <ul>
           <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1vW9iSpLLk">An omnivore defends veganism</a></li>

		<!-- Socialism
		============================ -->
		<section id="idocs_socialism">
		  <h2>Socialism</h2>
		  <p class="text-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism">More info about socialism</a></p>
		  <p>I believe that advocating for socialism is one of the best ways to maximize the happiness of non-human animals, humans and reducing the amount of damage that climate change is doing to our planet.</p>
      <p>I'm an anarchist, which is one of the most far left ideologies out there, and I basically advocate for libertarian policies, taking into account which ones will maximize a greater amount of happiness.</p>
      <p>I don't necessarily believe in the idea of getting too much into the theory, because while I do appreciate it and find it important, I think the most important way to push for our ideas is to pragmatically ally with other political advocates (such as left leaning libertarians) in order to push for our common grounds and not get stuck on the theory.</p>
      <h4>No Tankies Here</h4>
      <p>I completely disavow tankies, and I honestly think they are not even part of the left, because most of the time they just get too hooked onto the iconography from failed socialist experiments aswell as deny genocides.</p>

		  <p class="text-4"><a href="https://ok2bme.ca/resources/kids-teens/what-does-lgbtq-mean/">More info about LGBTQ+</a></p>
      <p>I completely support the LGBTQ+ community, in its totality</p>
      <p>Most people who argue against LGBTQ+ issues don't really understand about many issues regarding sex and gender</p>
      <h4>Trans Issues</h4>
      <p>Most of the backlash is centered nowadays towards trans people.</p>
      <p>I totally support the trans community, including their participation when it comes to sports aswell as the use of puberty blockers on trans youth.</p>
      <p>These are some good research documents that summarize my views about these issues:</p>

		<!-- Abortion
		============================ -->
		<section id="idocs_abortion">
		<h2>Abortion</h2>
		<p class="text-4"><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0959353516689521">More info about abortion</a></p>
    <p>I believe that abortion shouldn't be regulated, and I'm a pro-choice individual</p>
    <p>While I think we all consider that life begins at conception, I think the main question that needs to be asked is about whether the fetus has 'personhood' or not.</p>
    <p>In my opinion, applying personhood to a fetus is something that would make things very difficult aswell as complicate several processes such as: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the fetus truly has personhood, then, in case the person carrying the fetus commits a crime, would that mean that the person can't be arrested because the fetus would be illegally arrested?</li>
      <li>If the fetus truly has personhood, would that mean that all human rights apply to them?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Aswell, I think we have to take into account that bodily autonomy is also a valid argument in favour of abortion: even if someone provokes a car crash and injures someone in the process, and then the perpetrator is connected to the victim's body in order to keep them alive, the perpetrator can still make the decision about whether he wants to keep connected to the other person or not, because bodily autonomy is already highly prioritized in most countries.</p>
    <p>We also have to take into account that the quality of life is probably way more important than the 'sanctity' of life</p>

		============================ -->
        <section id="idocs_antifa">
          <h2>Antifa and Fascism</h2>
          <p>I'm against the ideologies of fascism and authoritarianism.</p>
          <p>There is already enough evidence to suggest that white supremacy is an increasing problem that we can realise about just by seeing the amount of reactionary values that are increasingly becoming more mainstream as each day passes by.</p>
          <p>I disagree with conservatives, because I truly believe their ideologies are just based upon the idea of trying to pass their emotionally based opinions as valid opinions</p>
          <p>I support the idea of political violence against fascists using both legal and extra-legal means.</p>

		<!-- Riots
		============================ -->

          <h2>Riots</h2>
          <p class="text-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot">More info about riots</a></p>
          <p>I think riots are justified, just like Black Lives Matter. Politics are violence and riots are just a way in which certain groups of society show their anger towards systems that have not been favourable towards them.</p>
          <p>If we don't want more riots to happen, then we have to start taking more into account those minorities that political systems all around the world haven't helped at all.</p>
          <p>I'm not someone that particularly loves the burning down of small businesses definitely though.</p>
          <p>Some research documents that justify my positions are: </p>

          <p>I believe that countries should help between one another, and once all countries are at around the same living conditions, we could finally get rid of borders.</p>
          <p>However, I do not support interventionism only done with the purpose of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/18/silence-us-backed-coup-evo-morales-bolivia-american-states">provoking coups in South America</a>,for example</p>
